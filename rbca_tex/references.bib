  abstract = {The rapid growth of industry and transport within this contemporary progress, there was sufficient consideration given to air quality monitoring; but conventional air quality monitoring methods are inefficient to produce adequate spatial and temporal resolutions of the air quality information by cost-effective also the period time clarifications. During the paper, we propose a distinct methodology to achieve the air quality monitoring system, using this fog computing-based Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper proposed an embedded system, where sensors collect the air quality information within period time and send it over the fog nodes. Every fog node may be an extraordinarily virtualized program hosted at a committed computing node implemented with a connection interface. Data gathered by Microprocessor based IoT sensing things do not seem to be causing on into the cloud server to the process. Preferably, they do send through the adjacent fog node to get quick, including high-rise rate service. Though, fog node will refine non-actionable data (e.g., regular device measurement) also forward them to the Cloud for lengthy run storage and batch analytics. The Cloud may be a convenient location to run world analytics at information gathered from commonly shared devices over sustained periods (months, years). General purpose processor (microprocessor) and IoT cloud platforms were involved in developing this whole infrastructure and model for analysis. Empirical outcomes reveal that this advanced method is responsible for sensing air quality, which serves to expose the modification patterns regarding air quality through a certain level.}

  abstract  = "Gas poisoning, both voluntary and involuntary, has a high
               incidence and is often accompanied by high mortality.
               Occupational exposures and fires are the most common sources of
               inhalation injury. Suffocants chemicals are substances that
               cause oxygen deficiency without interfering with respiratory
               mechanics by altering biological oxidative mechanisms. Among the
               main chemical fixing agents are carbon monoxide and cyanide,
               which act by altering cellular respiration through blocks of
               mitochondrial enzymes. When exposed inadequately to both gases,
               they can cause symptoms ranging from mild and nonspecific
               symptoms to alterations at the neurological and cardiovascular
               levels or even death within minutes. It is important to know the
               comprehensive management of patients intoxicated by biochemical
               asphyxiants, in the case of carbon monoxide, the adequate use of
               oxygen and support measures, and in the case of cyanide,
               antidotes and their adequate administration, in order to
               decrease mortality and aftermath.",
