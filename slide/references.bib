  abstract  = "Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning continues to be a significant
               health problem both in the United States and in many other
               countries. CO poisoning is associated with a high incidence of
               severe morbidity and mortality. Epidemics of CO poisoning
               commonly occur during winter months and sources include: smoke
               from fires, fumes from heating systems burning fuels, and
               exhaust fumes from motor vehicles. The history of exposure and
               carboxyhemoglobin levels should alert the physician to this
               diagnosis. In the absence of exposure history, CO poisoning
               should be considered when two or more patients are
               simultaneously sick. The clinical presentation is non-specific
               and may range from nausea and headache to profound central
               nervous system dysfunction. The mainstay of therapy for CO
               poisoning is supplemental oxygen, ventilatory support, and
               monitoring for cardiac dysrhythmias. This article reviews
               up-to-date information of this potentially devastating exposure.",
